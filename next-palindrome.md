# Problem - Next Palindrome
Any number that reads the same way forwards as it does backwards is a palindrome. For instance, `12321` would be considered a palindrome, whereas `123` would not be. 

Write a function that takes in an integer and returns the next palindrome. For instance:

```js
findNextPalindrome(100)
// should return 101
```

and 

```js
findNextPalindrome(101)
// should return 111
```

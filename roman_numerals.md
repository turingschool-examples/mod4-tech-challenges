[What are Roman Numerals?](https://www.mathsisfun.com/roman-numerals.html)

Write a function that converts an integer into a string such that the number is represented in Roman Numerals in the most efficient way.

For example, the number `4` could be written as `IIII` but it's more efficient to use `IV`since that's a shorter string.

Assume no number is greater than 4,000.

Here are the Roman Numeral equivalents you'll need to know:
- M=1000
- CM=900 
- D=500 
- CD=400
- C=100 
- XC=90 
- L=50 
- XL=40
- X=10 
- IX=9 
- V=5 
- IV=4 
- I=1

## JS Starter Code
```js
function toRoman(num) {
  // your code goes here
}

console.log(toRoman(128));  // should return "CXXVIII"
console.log(toRoman(2000)); // should return "MM"
console.log(toRoman(2017)); // should return "MMXVII"
console.log(toRoman(1999)); // should return "MCMXCIX"
```

## Ruby Starter Code
```rb
def to_roman(num)
  # your code goes here
end

puts to_roman(128)   # should return "CXXVIII"
puts to_roman(2000)  # should return "MM"
puts to_roman(2017)  # should return "MMXVII"
puts to_roman(1999)  # should return "MCMXCIX"
```

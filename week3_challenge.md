# Problem - The Snail
![Snail](https://media.giphy.com/media/n17GyE4DbZfbO/giphy.gif)
Given an n x n array, write a method that returns the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.

A good way to visualize this is to picture the spiral shell of a snail! 

## JS Example
```js
const arrayMatrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];

snail(arrayMatrix) #=> [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
```

## Ruby Example
```rb
arrayMatrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
];

snail(arrayMatrix) #=> [1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 8, 7, 4, 5]
```
